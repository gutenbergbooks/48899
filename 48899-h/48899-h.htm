The Battle for Saipan</h2>

<p class="p0 in0" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><i>by Captain John C. Chapin, USMCR (Ret)</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was to be a brutal
day. At first light on 15
June 1944, the Navy
fire support ships of
the task force lying off
Saipan Island increased their previous
days’ preparatory fires involving
all calibers of weapons. At 0542,
Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly
Turner ordered, “Land the landing
force.” Around 0700, the landing
ships, tank (LSTs) moved to within
approximately 1,250 yards behind
the line of departure. Troops in the
LSTs began debarking from them in
landing vehicles, tracked (LVTs).
Control vessels containing Navy
and Marine personnel with their
radio gear took their positions displaying
flags indicating which
beach approaches they controlled.</p>

<p>Admiral Turner delayed H-hour
from 0830 to 0840 to give the “boat
waves” additional time to get into
position. Then the first wave
headed full speed toward the
beaches. The Japanese waited patiently,
ready to make the assault
units pay a heavy price.</p>

<p>The first assault wave contained
armored amphibian tractors
(LVT[A]s) with their 75mm guns firing
rapidly. They were accompanied
by light gunboats firing 4.5-inch
rockets, 20mm guns, and 40mm
guns. The LVTs could negotiate the
reef, but the rest could not and
were forced to turn back until a
passageway through the reef could
be discovered.</p>

<p>Earlier, at 0600, further north, a
feint landing was conducted off
Tanapag harbor by part of the 2d
Marines in conjunction with the 1st
Battalion, 29th Marines, and the
24th Marines. The Japanese were
not really fooled and did not rush
reinforcements to that area, but
it did tie up at least one enemy
regiment.</p>

<p>When the LVT(A)s and troop-carrying
LVTs reached the reef, it
seemed to explode. In every direction
and in the water beyond on the
way to the beaches, great geysers of
water rose with artillery and mortar
shells exploding. Small-arms fire, rifles,
and machine guns joined the
mounting crescendo. The LVTs
ground ashore.</p>

<p>Confusion on the beaches, particularly
in the 2d Marine Division
area, was compounded by the
strength of a northerly current flow
which caused the assault battalions
of the 6th and 8th Marines to land
about 400 yards too far north. This
caused a gap to widen between the
2d and 4th Marine Divisions. As
Colonel Robert E. Hogaboom, the
operations officer of the Expeditionary
Troops commented: “The
opposition consisted primarily of
artillery and mortar fire from
weapons placed in well-deployed
positions and previously registered
to cover the beach areas, as well as
fire from small arms, automatic
weapons, and anti-boat guns sited
to cover the approaches to and
the immediate landing beaches.”</p>

  <div class="caption">PACIFIC OCEAN AREAS</div></div>

<p>As a result, five of the 2d Marine
Division assault unit commanders
were soon wounded in
the two battalions of the 6th
Marines (on the far left), and in the
two battalions of the 8th Marines.
With Afetan Point in the middle
spitting deadly enfilade fire to the
left and to the right, the next units
across the gap were two battalions
of the 23d Marines and, finally, on
the far right, two battalions of the
25th Marines.</p>

<p>Although the original plan had
been for the assault troops to ride
their LVTs all the way to the O-1
(first objective) line, the deluge of
Japanese fire and natural obstacles
prevented this. A few units in the
center of the 4th Division made it,
but fierce enemy resistance pinned
down the right and left flanks. The
two divisions were unable to make
direct contact.</p>

<p>A first lieutenant in the 3d Battalion,
24th Marines, John C. Chapin,
later remembered vividly the extraordinary
scene on the beach when
he came ashore on D-Day:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All around us was the
chaotic debris of bitter combat:
Jap and Marine bodies lying in
mangled and grotesque positions;
blasted and burnt-out
pillboxes; the burning wrecks
of LVTs that had been knocked
out by Jap high velocity fire;
the acrid smell of high explosives;
the shattered trees; and
the churned-up sand littered
with discarded equipment.</p></blockquote>

<p>When his company moved inland
a short distance, it quickly experienced
the frightening precision
of the pre-registered Japanese artillery
fire:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suddenly, WHAM! A shell
hit right on top of us! I was too
surprised to think, but instinctively
all of us hit the deck and
began to spread out. Then the
shells really began to pour
down on us: ahead, behind, on
both sides, and right in our
midst. They would come rocketing
down with a freight-train
roar and then explode with a
deafening cataclysm that is beyond
description.</p>

<p>It finally dawned on me
that the first shell bursts we’d
heard had been ranging shots,
and now that the Japs were
“zeroed in” on us, we were
caught in a full-fledged barrage.
The fire was hitting us
with pin-point accuracy, and it
was not hard to see why&mdash;towering
1500 feet above us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
was Mt. Tapotchau, with Jap
observation posts honeycombing
its crest.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="caption"><p>D-DAY AT SAIPAN</p>

<p class="small">INITIAL LANDINGS AND NIGHT<br />
DEFENSIVE POSITION</p></div></div>

<p>That night the lieutenant and his
runner shared a shallow foxhole
and split the watches between
them. Death came close:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, the
hours of my watch passed,
and at last I leaned over and
shook my runner awake. “It’s
time for your watch,” I whispered.
“Look out for that place
over there, maybe Japs in it.
Keep awake.” With that I
rolled over on the ground and
was asleep in an instant.</p>

<p>Right away, it seemed,
someone was shaking me and
insisting, “Wake up!” I jerked
bolt upright&mdash;in combat your
reflexes act fast and you never
go fully to sleep. A glance at
my watch showed that it was
almost dawn.</p>

<p>I turned to my runner who
was lying against me, asleep.
“Let’s go!” I said, “Pass the
word to the squad leaders to
get set.” He didn’t stir. I shook
him. He still didn’t move. He
was dead. With the callousness
that war demands, I rolled him
over, reached for his canteen,
and poured the precious water
into my own canteen. Then I
left him lying there....</p></blockquote>

<p>All the assault regiments were
taking casualties from the constant
shelling that was zeroed in by spotters
on the high ground inland.
Supplies and reinforcing units piled
up in confusion on the landing
beaches. Snipers were everywhere.
Supporting waves experienced the
same deadly enemy fire on their
way to the beach. Some LVTs lost
their direction, some received direct
hits, and others were flipped on
their sides by waves or enemy fire
spilling their equipment and personnel
onto the reef. Casualties in
both divisions mounted rapidly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Evacuating them to the ships was
extremely dangerous and difficult.
Medical aid stations set up ashore
were under sporadic enemy fire.</p>

<p>As the Marine artillery also
landed in the late afternoon of D-Day
and began firing in support of
the infantry, it received deadly accurate
counter-battery fire from the
Japanese. The commander of the
4th Division, Major General Harry
Schmidt, came ashore at 1930 and
later recalled, “Needless to say, the
command post during that time did
not function very well. It was the
hottest spot I was in during
the war....”</p>

<p>Major James A. Donovan, executive
officer of the 1st Battalion, 6th
Marines, endured a mortar barrage
that had uncanny timing and
precision:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We entered a little village
called Charan-Kanoa. We
paused there to get some
water. We had been pinched
out of our zone of action. We
were washing up and resting
when all of a sudden mortar
shells started to fall on us. We
didn’t know it at the time, but
in a tall smokestack nearby
was a Japanese forward observer.
He was directing the
fire, looking right down on us.
It didn’t occur to us that somebody
could be up in that
smokestack after all the
preparatory naval gunfire and
everything that had been fired
into the area, but he was up
there all right. He really
caused a great number of
casualties in G Company.</p>

<p>He caught us without foxholes.
We had that false sense
of security from having been
pinched out of the line. We
thought we had a chance to
relax. We didn’t. So all had to
dig holes in a hurry, and it’s
hard to dig a hole when you’re
lying on your stomach digging
with your chin, your elbows,
your knees, and your toes. It is
possible to dig a hole that way,
I found, but we lost far more
Marines than we should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
before someone finally located
that observer up in the smokestack.
I don’t know how tall
the smokestack was, but I
would say probably the equivalent
of two or three stories
high. From up there he could
see the entire picture, and he
really gave it to us.</p></blockquote>

<p>The night of D-Day saw continuous
Japanese probing of the Marine
positions, fire from by-passed
enemy soldiers, and an enemy attack
in the 4th Division zone
screened by a front of civilians. The
main counterattack, however, fell
on the 6th Marines on the far left of
the Marine lines. About 2,000
Japanese started moving south from
Garapan, and by 2200 they were
ready to attack. Led by tanks the
charge was met by a wall of fire
from .30-caliber machine guns,
37mm antitank guns, and M-1 rifles.
It was too much and they fell
back in disarray. In addition to 700
enemy dead, they left one tank. The
body of the bugler who blew the
charge was slumped over the open
hatch. A bullet had gone straight up
his bugle!</p>

<p>One of the crucial assets for the
Marine defense that night (and on
many subsequent nights) was the illumination
provided by star shells
fired from Navy ships. Japanese
records recovered later from their
<i>Thirty-first Army</i> message file revealed,
“... as soon as the night attack
units go forward, the enemy
points out targets by using the large
star shells which practically turn
night into day. Thus the maneuvering
of units is extremely difficult.”</p>

<p>As the weary Marines finally
tried to get some sleep, all along
their irregular line of foxholes, two
things were very clear to them:
they had forced a precarious beachhead
in the teeth of bitter enemy
fire, and a long, tough battle obviously
lay ahead.</p>

<p>While the thoughts of the riflemen
focused on survival and the
immediate ground in front of them,
the senior command echelons saw
the initial success of the landings as
a culmination of months of planning,
training, and organization for
a strategic strike on a crucial Japanese
stronghold. The opportunity for
this sprang from earlier Central Pacific
victories.</p>

<p>The Marine conquest of Tarawa
in the Gilbert Islands in November
1943, followed by the joint Marine-Army
capture of Kwajalein and
Eniwetok atolls in the Marshall Islands
in January-February 1944,
had broken the outer ring of Japanese
defenses and set the stage for
succeeding operations.</p>

<p>These earlier victories had
moved up the entire American operational
timetable for the Central
Pacific by three valuable months.
After discussions of various alternatives
(such as an attack on the vast
Japanese base at Truk), the Joint
Chiefs of Staff had settled on the
next objective: the Mariana Islands.
There were to be three principal
targets: Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. It
was a daring decision, for Saipan was
1,344 miles from the Marshalls and
3,226 miles from Hawaii, but only
1,250 miles from Japan. Furthermore,
the islands were linchpins in the revised
inner defense line which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Japanese felt they absolutely had to
hold after their previous losses in
the Central and Southwest Pacific.</p>

<p>Saipan represented a whole new
kind of prickly problem for an
American assault. Instead of a small,
flat coral islet in an atoll, it was a
large island target of some 72 square
miles, with terrain varying from flat
cane fields to swamps to precipitous
cliffs to the commanding 1,554-foot-high
Mount Tapotchau. Moreover,
the Japanese considered it “their
own territory,” in spite of the fact
that it was legally only a mandate
provided by the terms of the Versailles
Treaty following World War I.
The fact that Japan held the islands
led it to install a policy of exclusion
of all outsiders and the start of military
construction, forbidden by the
treaty, as early as 1934.</p>

<p>Attacking a formidable objective
such as Saipan called for complex
planning and much greater force
than had previously been needed in
the Central Pacific. An elaborate organization
was therefore assembled.
Admiral Raymond A. Spruance
was in overall command of the
force detailed to invade the Marianas
as well as the naval units
needed to protect them. Admiral
Turner was in command over the
amphibious task force, while Marine
Lieutenant General Holland M.
Smith was to direct the landing
forces on Saipan and then on the
neighboring island of Tinian. (A
similar command structure, but
with different combat units, was set
up for the attack on Guam to
the south.)</p>

<p>The operation plan for Saipan,
code-named Forager, called for an
assault on the western side of the island,
with the 2d Marine Division
on the left and the 4th Marine Division
on the right. The Army’s 27th
Infantry Division was in reserve,
ready to be fed into the battle if
needed. While each of the two Marine
divisions had previously
fought as a complete unit, the 27th
had experienced only two minor
landings (at Makin and Eniwetok
islets) for some of its regiments
and battalions.</p>

<p>The intensive training for these
three divisions took place in the
Hawaiian Islands with Major General
Harry Schmidt’s 4th Marine Division
on Maui, Major General
Thomas E. Watson’s 2d Marine Division
on the “Big Island” of
Hawaii, and Army Major General
Ralph C. Smith’s 27th Infantry Division
on Oahu. As Lieutenant
Chapin described it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(These) months were busy,
hard-working ones. The replacements
that arrived to fill
the gaps left by Namur’s casualties
(in the Kwajalein battle)
had to be trained in all the
complexities of field work.
Most of these replacements
were boys fresh from boot
camp, and they were ignorant
of everything but the barest essentials.
Week after week was
filled with long marches, field
combat problems, live firing,
obstacle courses, street fighting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
judo, calisthenics, night
and day attacks and defenses,
etc. There were also lectures
on the errors we’d made at
Namur. Added emphasis was
placed on attacking fortified
positions. We worked with demolition
charges of dynamite,
TNT, and C-2 [plastic explosive],
and with flame throwers
till everyone knew them forward
and backward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The month of May 1944 brought
final maneuvers and practice landings
for all three divisions. The operation
plan looked neatly and
efficiently organized on paper.
In practice it looked different to
that lieutenant:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To us in the lower echelons
it was just the same old stuff
that we’d been doing for a
solid year: filing up from compartments
below decks to your
assigned boat station, going
over the side, hurrying down
the net to beat the stopwatch,
into the heaving LCVP (Landing
Craft, Vehicle, Personnel),
and away. Then the interminable
hours of circling,
meanwhile getting wet, hungry
and bored. The K rations
(in a waxed box) tasted like
sawdust; the weather got
rougher and rougher. Some of
the men got seasick, and all of
us were soaking wet and cold.</p>

<p>Finally we headed back to
our transport and clambered
up the cargo net with a sigh of
relief. The next day it was the
same thing all over again, except
that this time we went
ashore. This, too, had an awfully
familiar feeling: wading
through the surf, getting your
only pair of shoes and socks
wringing wet, and then onto
the beach where all the sand
migrated inside your shoes. A
series of conflicting and confusing
orders flowed down
through the chain of command:
halt and move on, halt and
move on, go here, go there.</p></blockquote>

<p>The vast attack force now gathered
at Pearl Harbor. Although
there were unfortunate accidents to
some of the landing craft, over 800
ships set out in the naval component,
some for direct fire support
of the troops, some for transport,
and some (the fast carrier task
force) to make advance air strikes
and then to deal with the attack
which the landing probably would
incite from the Japanese Navy.
Holland Smith’s V Amphibious
Corps, totalling 71,034 Marine and
Army troops, sailed with some
slow elements starting on 25 May.
The specialized craft for the
ground forces ran the gamut of
acronym varieties. After staging
through the Marshalls, the armada
headed for the target: Saipan.</p>

<p>At sea the troops got their final
briefings: maps of the island (based
on recent American aerial and submarine
photographs of a hitherto
“secret island”), estimates of 15,000
enemy troops (which turned out in
the end to be 30,000 under the command
of Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu
Saito and Vice Admiral Chiuchi
Nagumo), and detailed attack
plans for two Marine divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Simultaneously, the American
fast carriers’ planes began, on 11
June, their softening-up bombing,
combined with attacks on Japanese
land-based air. Two days later, the
main enemy fleet headed for the
Marianas for a decisive battle. Then,
on 14 June, the “old battleships” of
the U.S. Navy, reborn from the
Pearl Harbor disaster, moved in
close to Saipan to pound the Japanese
defenses with their heavy guns.
That night underwater demolition
teams made their dangerous swim
in close to the assault beaches to
check on reefs, channels, mines, and
beach defenses. All was now in
readiness for the landings.</p>

<p>The bloody business of D-Day
was, as the troops well realized,
only a beginning, for the long, gruelling
fight which began the next
morning.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Lieutenant</span> General Holland M.
Smith, one of the most famous
Marines of World War II, was
born in 1882. He was commissioned
a second lieutenant in 1905. There
followed a series of overseas assignments
in the Philippines, Nicaragua,
Santo Domingo, and with the Marine
Brigade in France in World War I. Beginning
in the early 1930s, he became
increasingly focused on the development
of amphibious warfare concepts.
Soon after the outbreak of war
with Japan in 1941, he came to a crucial
position, command of all
Marines in the Central Pacific.</p>

<p>As another Marine officer later described
him, “He was of medium
height, perhaps five feet nine or ten
inches, and somewhat paunchy. His
once-black hair had turned gray. His
once close-trimmed mustache was
somewhat scraggly. He wore steel-rimmed
glasses and he smoked cigars
incessantly.” There was one other feature
that characterized him: a ferocious
temper that earned him the
nickname “Howlin’ Mad” Smith, although
his close friends knew him
as “Hoke.”</p>

<p>This characteristic would usually
emerge as irritation at what he felt
were substandard performances. One
famous example of this was his relief
of an Army general on Saipan. A huge
interservice uproar erupted!</p>

<p>Less than two years later, after 41
years of active service, during which
he was awarded four Distinguished
Service Medals for his leadership in
four successive successful amphibious
operations, he retired in April 1946,
as a four-star general. He died in
January 1967.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> origins of this division lay
in the activation of the 2d Marine
Brigade as part of the
Fleet Marine Force on 1 July 1936. A
year later the brigade deployed to
Shanghai, China, returning in 1938
to San Diego, California.</p>

<p>On 1 February 1941, the unit was
redesignated as the 2d Marine Division.
Its component regiments, the
2d, 6th, 8th, and 10th Marines,
brought with them impressive histories
of service in Vera Cruz (Mexico),
World War I in France, and the
Caribbean.</p>

<p>In World War II, elements of the
division served in Iceland, in Hawaii
during the attack on Pearl Harbor,
and on Samoa, then the full division
in the Guadalcanal campaign, followed
by the bloody assault of
Tarawa for which it was awarded a
Presidential Unit Citation, and on to
Saipan, Tinian, and Okinawa.</p>

<h4>The 2d Marine Division Patch</h4>

<p>This 2d Marine Division shoulder patch
was worn on Saipan. Designed and approved
in late 1943, the insignia is in
the official Marine Corps colors of scarlet
and gold. The insignia displays a
spearhead-shaped scarlet background
with a hand holding aloft a lighted gold
torch. A scarlet numeral “2” is superimposed
upon the torch, and the torch
and hand are encircled by five white
stars in the arrangement of the Southern
Cross constellation; under this the
division’s first World War II combat
took place at Guadalcanal.

<h3 title="The 4th Marine division">The 4th Marine Division</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> division had its roots in the
shifting and redesignation of
several other units. The 23d
Marines began as infantry detached
from the 3d Division in February
1943, the same month that an artillery
battalion became the genesis of the
14th Marines and engineer elements
of the 19th Marines formed the start
of the 20th Marines. In March the
24th Marines was organized, and
then in May it was split in two to
supply the men for the 25th Marines.</p>

<p>This war-time shuffling provided
the major building blocks for a new
division. The units were originally
separated, however, with the 24th
Marines and a variety of reinforcing
units (engineer, artillery, medical,
motor transport, special weapons,
tanks, etc.) at Camp Pendleton in
California. The rest of the units were
at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
This East Coast echelon moved to
Pendleton by train and also by ship
through the Panama Canal in July and
August 1943. All the units were now finally
together, and thus the 4th Marine
Division was formally activated on 14
August 1943.</p>

<p>After intensive training, it shipped
out on 13 January 1944, and in 13
short months made four major assault
landings: Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian,
and Iwo Jima, suffering over 17,000
casualties. It was awarded two Presidential
Unit Citations and a Navy
Unit Commendation, and then deactivated
28 November 1945. In February
1966, however, it was reactivated as
the lead division in the Marine Corps
Reserve, and it furnished essential
units to Desert Storm in the liberation
of Kuwait.</p>

<h4>The 4th Marine Division Patch</h4>

<p>Worn on Saipan, it had a gold “4” on a
scarlet background, the official colors
of the U.S. Marine Corps. This
emblem was designed by SSgt John
Fabion, a member of the division’s
public affairs office before the Marshalls
campaign. His commanding
officer was astonished to find that,
when the division attacked Roi islet
in Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall
Islands (January 1944), the layout of
the runways on the Japanese airstrip
there were “an exact replica.”

<h3 title="The Army 27th Infantry Division">The Army 27th Infantry Division</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> division, before the national
emergency was declared
in 1940, was a State of
New York National Guard organization.
It contained many famous old
regiments, some dating from the Revolutionary
and Civil Wars. In World
War II, the division’s 165th Infantry
had been the renowned old 69th New
York Infantry, also known as the
“Fighting 69th” and “Fighting Irish” of
World War I fame. The first unit of
this regiment was organized in 1775.</p>

<p>As the war in Europe grew in intensity,
the Selective Service Act gave
the President the power to federalize
the National Guard. Thus, the 27th
Division was activated by President
Roosevelt on 25 September 1940. It
was first sent to Fort McClellan, Alabama,
for intensive training, and
then, in December 1941, to California.</p>

<p>On 28 February 1942, the first elements
of the division sailed from San
Francisco and landed at the town of
Hilo on the “Big Island” of Hawaii.
During the next two months, the division
units were scattered throughout
the island for local defense and
training. That was the start of the
longest wartime overseas service of
any National Guard division in the
United States Army.</p>

<div id="if_i_007" class="figright" style="width: 152px;">
  <img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="152" height="154" alt="" /></div>

<p>In the fall of 1942, the division
was directed to assemble on the island
of Oahu. MajGen Ralph C.
Smith took over command at that
time. Then in midsummer 1943, orders
came to prepare the 165th Infantry
Regiment, reinforced by a battalion
of the 105th Infantry and an
artillery battalion, for an assault to
capture the coral atoll of Makin, in
the Gilbert Islands chain. Following
a four-day battle there, in November
1943, the division furnished a battalion
of the 106th Infantry for the unopposed
occupation of Majuro in the
Marshall Islands in January 1944.</p>

<p>The final prelude to Saipan for
units of the 27th came the next
month. Two battalions of the 106th
fought at Eniwetok Atoll in the
Marshalls.</p>

<p>After the division’s struggle on
Saipan, it went on to the battle for
Okinawa in April 1945, and then
to the occupation of Japan in September
1945.</p>

<p>The final chapter came in December
1946 when the 27th Infantry
Division was deactivated.

<h2><a name="D1-D2_16-17_June" id="D1-D2_16-17_June"></a><i>D+1&ndash;D+2, 16&ndash;17 June</i></h2>

<p>The next two days saw the Marine
attack resumed all along the irregular
front. The 2d Division, after
reorganizing, pushed its 6th
Marines northeast toward Mount
Tipo Pali, its 2d Marines north towards
Garapan, and its 8th Marines
east into the swamps around Lake
Susupe. Direct contact with the 4th
Division was finally established.</p>

<p>Close combat was the norm.
There were no exceptions for battalion
commanders. Lieutenant
Colonel Justice M. Chambers, commanding
the 3d Battalion, 25th
Marines in the 4th Division later
described two of his experiences
on D+1:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We came to a big bomb
crater. The soil had all been
thrown up, and around it there
were three Marines protected
by the dirt. I called up to one
of these Marines and asked
him what was going on. One
of them said that there was an
antiaircraft gun right down in
front of them. I crawled up
within two or three feet of the
top of the dirt and raised up on
my hands to see what was
down there.</p>

<p>Within about 25 to 30 yards,
I was looking right into the
muzzle of an 88mm antiaircraft/antitank
gun. They had
swung the damn thing around,
and it was pointing right up
the hill. I was looking right
down its muzzle. I dropped as
hard as I could and then the
damn gun went off. The shell
tore through the far side of the
bomb crater, came through the
dirt on the near side of the
bomb crater where I was. It
took the head off the Marine
with whom I had been talking.
The shell went on back and
landed about 20 or 30 feet beyond
us where it detonated.
Later that same day, he had
another close call.</p>

<p>We had, as we had advanced,
uncovered various
Japanese supply caches. One
of these was an ammunition
dump.... About 1505 the
Japs blew the large dump near
where I was standing and
caused numerous concussion
casualties including myself....
I don’t remember a thing
about it. The boys tell me that,
when the blast went off, I was
thrown right up in the air, and
I turned a complete flip and
then landed on my face.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the night of D+1, the
Japanese again launched a major
attack on the 6th Marines, this
time with 44 tanks. Major Donovan
later described the wild clash:
“The battle evolved itself into a
madhouse of noise, tracers, and
flashing lights. As tanks were hit
and set afire, they silhouetted
other tanks coming out of the
flickering shadows to the front or
already on top of the squads.” The
Marines poured in their fire, now
with 2.36-inch rocket launchers,
grenade launchers, self-propelled
75mm guns, and their own artillery
and tanks adding to the
din. When dawn broke, it was
over and the shattered hulks of 24
Japanese tanks lay there smoking.</p>

<p>In the 4th Division zone of action,
the left regiment, the 23d,
also had a difficult time in the
Susupe swamp. The 24th and 25th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
drove inland to the east towards
the key objective of Aslito airfield.
With a danger looming of overextended
lines, Lieutenant General
Holland Smith pulled the 165th
Infantry out of his reserve (the
Army’s 27th Infantry Division)
and sent it ashore on D+2 to reinforce
the 4th Marine Division. This
same day, Major General Ralph
Smith came ashore to take command
of the additional Army units
of his 27th Division as they landed.</p>

<p>With the 165th Infantry on its
right flank and the 24th Marines
to its left, the 25th Marines was
poised on the north edge of Aslito
airfield late on D+2. Its patrols
found the strip was abandoned,
but the 165th, assigned to capture
it, decided to wait until the
next day.</p>

<p>The division had finally approached
the O-1 line, except on
the left flank where contact with
the 2d Division was again broken,
this time near Mount Fina Susu.</p>

<p>This same day 17 June, saw a
crucial command decision by
Admiral Spruance. With the powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
main Japanese fleet now
approaching Saipan, he ordered
his fast carriers to meet the enemy
ships, and that night withdrew
his transports and supply
ships from their offshore support positions
to a safe distance from the
Japanese threat.</p>

then at Saipan in the Marianas.</p>

<p>Born in 1886, he entered the Corps as
a second lieutenant in 1909. By extraordinary
coincidence, his first foreign
duty was at Guam in the Marianas Islands,
an area he would return to 33
years later under vastly different circumstances!</p>

<p>The Philippines, Mexico, Cuba, and
Nicaragua (where he was awarded a
Navy Cross&mdash;second only to the Medal
of Honor), interspersed with repeated
stays in China, were the marks of a
diverse overseas career. At home there
were staff schools, paymaster duties,
and a tour as Assistant Commandant.</p>

<p>By the end of World War II, he had
been decorated with three Distinguished
Service Medals. Retiring in
1948 after 39 years of service, he was
advanced to the four-star rank of general.
His death came in 1968.</p>

<p>A contemporary described him as “a
Buddha, a typical old-time Marine: he’d
been in China; he was regulation, Old
Establishment, a regular Marine.”

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> training before Saipan was based on a new Table of Organization
for the Marine divisions. Their size was reduced by 2,500 men to

were reorganized to total 13, using three “fire teams” of four men with each
team built around a Browning automatic rifle (BAR), a 50 percent increase in
the division of this valuable weapon. The number of 60mm mortars in the division
table of equipment was similarly expanded, while the number of
flamethrowers grew ten-fold. In addition, the tank battalions were able to replace
their antiquated light tanks with mediums.

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="D3_18_June" id="D3_18_June"></a><i>D+3, 18 June</i></h2>

<p>When the infantrymen ashore
woke the next morning, they
looked out in amazement at the
empty ocean and a wave of uneasy
questions raced through their
minds: “Where in hell are our
ships? What about food and ammunition
we’ve got to have? Will we
get back the daytime naval supporting
gunfire and also the star shell illumination?”
The men in frontline
combat had no way of knowing
that over 33,000 tons of cargo had
already been unloaded when the
ships withdrew.</p>

<p>Both Marine divisions went on
the attack, while the 105th Infantry
joined the 165th on the far right
flank, enabling Ralph Smith to put
his 27th Division into motion to occupy
Aslito airfield and attack
along the southern coast.</p>

<p>That same morning, 18 June, the
4th Marine Division attack objective
was the seizure of the O-3 line.
This would mean reaching the east
coast of Saipan and splitting in two
the Japanese forces. First, however,
the 23d Marines, reinforced by a
battalion of the 24th Marines, had
to seize the portion of the O-2 line
in its zone. This was to be the division’s
line of departure. The entire
division, with three infantry regiments
abreast, jumped off at 1040.
At 1340 the 25th Marines had
reached O-3. The 24th Marines had
tank-led Japanese counterattacks
on both flanks but was able to
reach O-3 before dark.</p>

<p>The 23d Marines, however, was
stopped by intense enemy mortar
and machine gun fire coming from
southeast of Lake Susupe right on
the boundary line between the two
Marine divisions, making it unclear
which division had responsibility
for wiping out these enemy
positions. At the same time, it was
impossible to fire artillery on them
for fear of hitting friendly troops.
As a result, the 23d Marines suffered
heavy casualties. So, by the
end of the day, although all of the
4th Marine Division’s regiments
were in contact, a gap still existed
between the two Marine divisions.</p>

<p>The bizarre becomes commonplace
in combat. For instance, one
of the 23d Marines’ 75mm half-tracks
fired into a Japanese cave
that day, and a dense cloud of noxious
fumes came pouring out. A
gas alarm was sounded. This meant
serious trouble, for all the riflemen
had long since jettisoned their burdensome
gas masks. Relief flooded
through the men as it was established
that the fumes were not poisonous
and came from picric acid
the Japanese had stored in the cave.</p>

<p>Over in the 2d Division’s zone,
the 8th Marines saw some bitter
fighting over Hill 240. A heavily defended
coconut grove required saturation
fire from the artillery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
10th Marines before the riflemen
could smash their way in and clean
out the grove.</p>

<p>The price for the two Marine divisions
had been heavy. By the night
of D+3 they had been bled by more
than 5,000 casualties.</p>

<h2><a name="D4-D7_19-22_June" id="D4-D7_19-22_June"></a><i>D+4&ndash;D+7, 19&ndash;22 June</i></h2>

<p>The most critical event of 19 June
(and perhaps the most important of
the whole Saipan campaign) took
place at sea, well out of sight of the
infantrymen ashore. The opposing
carrier task forces clashed in a gigantic
air battle. When it was over
that night, the Japanese had suffered
the catastrophic loss of 330 out of
430 planes they had launched. Exultant
U.S. Navy fliers labelled it “The
Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.” With
the help of American submarines
and additional carrier plane attacks
the next day, the Japanese attempt
to relieve Saipan by a decisive naval
victory was smashed. As an official
account summarized the impact
ashore, “the eventual doom of the
enemy garrison was assured.” And
the American supply ships were
able to return offshore to unload
their vital cargoes.</p>

<p>During the four-day span of D+4
to D+7, the 105th Infantry moved
slowly along the south coast and
then joined the 165th Infantry in
sealing off the die-hard Japanese
survivors in Nafutan Point, in the
southeastern corner of the island.
Once the enemy was penned in, the
105th was assigned to eliminate him.
The rest of the 27th Division, now
including the 106th Infantry, was ordered
north to be the Corps reserve.</p>

<p>This period, 19&ndash;22 June, marked a
total shift in direction for the American
troops. Pivoting on the 2d
Marines on the far left flank along
the western shore, the other Marine
regiments swung around from their
drive which had reached the east
coast to face north, with their right
flank on Magicienne Bay.</p>

<p>On 20 June, the 4th Division confronted
a key objective. Lieutenant
Chapin had a ringside seat:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We had a perfect chance to
watch a battalion of the 25th
making an attack.... It was
in action about a quarter of a
mile from us, and the whole
panorama was spread out before
us. They were assaulting
Hill 500, the dominant terrain
feature of the whole area, and
it was apparent that they were
running into a solid wall of
Jap fire. But, using [artillery]
timed fire, smoke, and tanks,
they finally stormed the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
and took it. The use of those
supporting arms provided a
magnificent spectacle. From
our vantage point, we could
see the timed fire bursting in
cave entrances, and moving
down the face of the hill as
precisely as if ... it were
going down a stepladder. On
the lower levels, the flamethrower
tanks were spouting
their napalm jets upward
into other caves. It was quite
a sight!</p></blockquote>

  <div class="caption"><p>SAIPAN</p>

<p class="small">16&ndash;22 JUNE 1944</p></div></div>

<p>Over in the area of the 2d Division,
the 8th Marines wheeled from
facing east to attack northward into
the foot hills leading to Mount
Tapotchau.</p>

<p>The Marine divisions were now
facing two major problems. First,
their drive north was confronted by
General Saito’s main line of defense,
running west to east across
the island. Secondly, the terrain into
which the attack had to go was a
nightmare of ravines, caves, hills,
valleys, and cliffs&mdash;all fortified
and defended to the death by
the Japanese.</p>

<p>June 21 brought a respite for the
front line troops: “D+6 was enjoyed
by all&mdash;for a change! We rested on
our positions; caught up on sorely
needed sleep; got some water
(which had been conspicuous by its
absence); and even had a good hot
meal. For we got our first 10-in-1 rations.
Did they ever taste good to
our hungry palates, surfeited as
they were with K rations!”</p>

<p>Simultaneously, intensive preparations
were made for a coordinated
attack by both Marine divisions
the next morning. A total of
18 artillery battalions were massed
for supporting fire. Combat efficiency
was officially rated as “very
satisfactory,” in spite of a sobering
total of 6,165 casualties.</p>

<p>The following day saw the
Marines attack all along the line.
The 6th Marines overran parts of
Mount Tipo Pali, while the 8th
Marines worked its painful way
into the maze of ridges and gullies
that formed the foothills of Mount
Tapotchau. On the right, the 24th
Marines was forced into the messy
business of blasting caves honeycombed
along Magicienne Bay.
In one of the mortar platoons, a
weird encounter took place, as described
at the time to this author
by the participant, First Lieutenant
Joseph J. Cushing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[I] was bending over one of
[my] mortars, checking the lay
of it, when [I] felt a tap on my
shoulder, and a guy asked
[me], “Hey, Mac, are you a Marine?”
[I] turned around and
there was a Jap officer standing
about a foot from [me]. [I]
dropped to the ground,
speechless with amazement,
and [my] men riddled the Jap
from head to toe.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the left of the 4th Division,
the 25th Marines made a major advance
of 2,400 yards. The forward
lines were now reaching an area
where the Kagman Peninsula jutted
out to the east. This resulted in a
substantially increased frontage
that the two Marine divisions could
not properly cover. To deal with
this, Holland Smith decided to commit
his reserve, the 27th Infantry
Division, to the center of the line,
leaving just one battalion of the
105th Infantry way back in the rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to continue its long drawn-out attempt
to eliminate the Japanese
pocket on by-passed Nafutan Point.</p>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>Still another cane field, with its hidden Japanese defenders lying in wait, confronts these Marine riflemen.</i></p></div></div>

<p>This day (D+7) was also marked
by the arrival of P-47 Thunderbolts
of the 19th Fighter Squadron, U.S.
Army Air Forces, which landed at
Aslito Field. They had been
launched from Navy escort carriers.
When landed, they were fitted with
launching racks for rockets by
ground crews who had come in earlier.
Later that day, eight planes
took off on their first support mission
of the Saipan campaign. (Only
two Marine observation squadrons,
VMO-2 and VMO-4, were involved
in the battle for Saipan, but they
provided invaluable artillery spotting
for the two Marine divisions.)</p>

<p>While these developments were
taking place in the upper echelons,
down in the rock-bottom basic life
of infantry platoons, the days of relentless
combat pressure were exemplified
by their impact on the
constant duties and high stress levels
on a platoon commander:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I made a final inspection of
the platoon position and then
sacked in&mdash;exhausted. When it
came my turn to stand watch,
it took every last reserve of
willpower and strength to get
up and go on duty. Then for
hours I alternated between
fighting off my sleepiness and
sweating out the noises and
movements that were all
around us.</p>

<p>After a while, I spotted a
shape, darker than the rest of
the surrounding shadows. It
was the size of a man’s head. I
watched it for a long time,
nerves on edge, finger on my
carbine trigger. Finally it
seemed to move. I fired a shot.
Nothing happened. It
would’ve been suicide to go
over and investigate. In that
darkness and jungle my own
men would’ve shot me in a
second. So when it came time
for my relief, I pointed out the
suspicious object to the next
man, told him to watch it
closely, and collapsed into a
dead-tired sleep.</p>

<p>When dawn came on D+8, I
was awakened, and the first
thing I did was to look over
where I’d shot on the night before.
There, lying on top of a
rock, was the gas mask of one
of my men! The owner had
been sleeping right beside it. It
was a miracle he hadn’t been
hit. The tremendous strain of
the previous night did funny
things to your mind....</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="D8-D15_23-30_June" id="D8-D15_23-30_June"></a><i>D+8&ndash;D+15, 23&ndash;30 June</i></h2>

<p>Complications of a serious nature
arose in the execution of the battle
plan for 23 June. The battalion of
the 105th Infantry still had not
cleaned out Nafutan Point; there
were semantic and communications
differences between the two Smith
generals as to orders about who
would do what and when; the 106th
and 165th Infantry got all tangled
up in themselves during a march to
take over the center portion of the
American lines and were too late to
jump off in the attack, thus delaying
the attacks of the Marines. When
the Army regiments did move out,
they found that the rugged terrain
in their sector and the determined
enemy in camouflaged weapons
positions in caves of the steep slope
leading up to Mount Tapotchau
made forward progress slow and
difficult. The 27th Infantry Division
was stalled.</p>

<p>The corps commander, Holland
Smith, was very displeased with
this situation. It had started with
the difficulties experienced in getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
that division ashore; it was exacerbated
by the time it was taking
to secure Nafutan Point and the
mix-up in orders there; now the advancing
Marine divisions were getting
infiltration and enfilading fire
on their flanks because of the 27th’s
lack of progress.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Lieutenant General
Holland Smith met that afternoon
with Major General Sanderford
Jarman, USA, who was slated to be
the island garrison commander,
and asked him to press Major
General Ralph Smith for much
more aggressive action by the 27th.
Jarman later stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I talked to General (Ralph)
Smith and explained the situation
as I saw it and that I felt
from reports from the corps
commander that his division
was not carrying its full share.
He immediately replied that
such was true; that he was in no
way satisfied with what his regimental
commanders had done
during the day and that he had
been with them and had
pointed out to them the situation.
He further indicated to me
that he was going to be present
tomorrow, 24 June, with his division
when it made its jump-off
and he would personally see to
it that the division went forward....
He appreciated the situation
and thanked me for coming
to see him and stated that if he
didn’t take his division forward
tomorrow he should be relieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>This blunt meeting was followed
the next morning (D+9) by an even
blunter message from Holland
Smith to Ralph Smith:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Commanding General is
highly displeased with the
failure of the 27th Division on
June twenty-third to launch its
attack as ordered at King hour
and the lack of offensive action
displayed by the division
in its failure to advance and
seize objective O-5 when opposed
by only small arms and
mortar fire.</p>

<p>The failure of the 27th to advance
in its zone of action resulted
in the halting of attacks
by the 4th and 2d Marine Divisions
on the flanks of the 27th
in order to prevent dangerous
exposure of their interior
flanks. It is directed that immediate
steps be taken to
cause the 27th Division to advance
and seize the objectives
as ordered.</p></blockquote>

<p>These objectives were given dramatic
names by the Army regiments:
Hell’s Pocket, Death Valley,
and Purple Heart Ridge. It was certainly
true that the terrain was perfect
for the dug-in Japanese defenders:
visibility from the slopes
of Mount Tapotchau and from the
ridge gave them fields of fire to
rake any attack up the valley. Holland
Smith didn’t fully recognize
the severity of the opposition, and,
by the end of the day, the 106th
Infantry had gained little, while
the 165th Infantry had been
“thrown back onto the original line
of departure.”</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the 2d Marine Division
on the left was painfully slugging
its way forward in the tortuous
environs around Mount
Tapotchau. The 4th Marine Division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
(on the right) pivoted east,
driving fast into the Kagman
Peninsula. There the ground was
level, a plus, but covered with cane
fields, a big minus, as the rifle
companies well knew.</p>

<p>A platoon leader remarked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The terrain here consisted of
countless cane fields&mdash;one
after another. And it was the
same old story: in every field
the company would lose a
man or two. It was wonderfully
quieting to the nerves to
start into a growth of head-high
cane, and wonder who
would not be coming out on
the other side! The Jap snipers
who were doing the damage
were dug in so deeply, and
camouflaged so well, that it
was impossible to locate them
before they fired. And then it
was too late; you were right on
top of them, and they had
nailed another one of your
men&mdash;or maybe you! Then
there was always that next
cane field up ahead....</p>

<p>Some of the fields had been
burnt out by the napalm-bombing
of our planes. This
gave us greatly increased observation
as we went through
them, but clouds of choking
dust arose from the ashes to
plague us and dirty our
weapons. With water so
scarce, one of our chief sources
of liquid sustenance was sugar
cane juice. We’d whack off a
segment of the cane with our
combat knives, then chew and
suck on it till only the dry
fibers were left. In these burnt-out
fields we weren’t even
able to do this, as the cane was
spoiled and tasted lousy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Along with the death toll in the
cane fields came the physical demands
placed on the troops by the
hot tropical climate. Lieutenant
Chapin noted small, human issues
that loomed large in the minds of
the assault troops:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All this time the sun was
broiling down on top of us.
Our canteens had been empty
for hours. Everyone was absolutely
parched.... Finally
we did stop, as the effects of
heat exhaustion and lack of
water started to become apparent.
[Our company commander]
arranged for some
water to be brought up to our
position. When the cans
arrived, everyone crowded
thirstily around, and we
had to order the men to disperse....
Then each platoon
leader rationed out a can of the
precious liquid amongst his
men. As was the age-old Marine
tradition, we waited till all our
men had their share before we
took ours. The water was lukewarm,
rusty, and oily as it came
out of the cans, but it still tasted
like nectar!</p></blockquote>

<p>While these local events transpired
on the front lines, a major
upheaval was taking place in the
rear. Seeing that the corps line
would be bent back some 1,500
yards in the zone of the 27th Infantry
Division, Holland Smith had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
had enough. He went to see Admirals
Spruance and Turner to obtain
permission to relieve Ralph Smith
of command of his division.</p>

<p>After reviewing the Marine
general’s deeply felt criticism of
the 27th Infantry Division’s “defective
performance,” the admirals
agreed to the requested
change, and Ralph Smith was superseded
by Major General Jarman
on 24 June.</p>

<p><i>As the fighting reached the interior of Saipan, the troops encountered
difficult foliage and terrain which impeded their movement.
Note the tops of the helmets of Marines peering from their foxholes.</i></p></div></div>

<p>A furor arose, with bitter interservice
recriminations, and the
flames were fanned by lurid press
reports. Holland Smith summarized
his feelings three days after
the relief. According to a unit history,
<i>The 27th Infantry Division in
World War II</i>, he stated, “The 27th
Division won’t fight, and Ralph
Smith will not make them fight.”
Army generals were furious, and in
Hawaii, Lieutenant General Robert
Richardson, commander of the U.S.
Army in the Pacific (USARPAC)
convened an Army board of inquiry
over the matter. The issue
reached to the highest military levels
in Washington.</p>

<p>While the Army’s Deputy Chief
of Staff, Lieutenant General Joseph
T. McNarney, reviewed the matter,
he found some faults with Holland
Smith, but then went on to say that
Ralph Smith failed to exact the performance
expected from a well-trained
division, as evidenced by
poor leadership on the part of some
regimental and battalion commanders,
undue hesitancy to bypass
snipers “with a tendency to alibi because
of lack of reserves to mop
up,” poor march discipline, and
lack of reconnaissance.</p>

<p>The Army’s official summary,
<i>United States Army in World War II,
The War in the Pacific, Campaign in
the Marianas</i> (published 15 years
after the operations) attributed
some errors to Holland Smith’s
handling of a real problem, and it
also gave full recognition to the difficult
terrain and bitter resistance
that the Army regiments faced. The
history stated that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... there is no doubt that
the 106th Infantry Regiment of
the 27th Division was late in
jumping off in the attack on
the morning of 23 June&mdash;even
though not so late as Holland
Smith charged. On the 23d and
again on the 24th, the Army
troops attacking Death Valley
were slow and faltering in
their advance. According to
the testimony of General Jarman,
who took over the division
from Ralph Smith, the unit
leaders of the 106th Infantry
were hesitant and apparently
confused. Although the Army
troops in Death Valley sustained
fairly heavy casualties,
the two Marine divisions on
the flanks suffered greater
ones. Yet the Marines made
considerable advances while
the 165th Infantry registered
only small gains&mdash;the 106th Infantry
almost none at all.</p>

<p>No matter what the extenuating
circumstances were&mdash;and
there were several&mdash;the conclusion
seems inescapable that
Holland Smith had good reason
to be disappointed with
the performance of the 27th Infantry
Division on the two
days in question....</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Back where the conflict was with
the Japanese, the 4th Marine Division
had overrun most of the Kagman
Peninsula by the night of
D+10. The shoreline cliffs provoked
sobering thoughts in a young officer
in the 24th Marines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We were close to the northern
shoreline of the peninsula.
And right there the Japs had
dug a big emplacement. They
hadn’t had time to finish it,
but we could see that it was
situated so as to fire right
down the beach-line. Any
troops landing on that beach
would have received a terrible
enfilading fire from this gun
position. Not far from the emplacement
were the guns that
had been destined to go into
it: huge, 5-inch, dual-purpose
naval guns. They were deadly
things, and I was glad the
enemy had never gotten them
into action. Now they lay
there on their wooden skids,
thickly coated with grease,
wrapped in burlap&mdash;impotent.</p></blockquote>

<p>This unfinished state of the Japanese
defenses was, in fact, a critical
factor in the final American victory
on Saipan. The blockading success of
far-ranging submarines of the U.S.
Navy had drastically reduced the
supplies of cement and other construction
materials destined for elaborate
Saipan defenses, as well as the
number of troop ships carrying
Japanese reinforcements to the island.
Then the quick success of the
Marshalls campaign had speeded up
the Marianas thrust by three
months. This was decisive, for “one
prisoner of war later said that, had
the American assault come three
months later, the island would have
been impregnable.”</p>

<p>The 4th Marine Division encountered
more than cane fields in
the Kagman Peninsula&mdash;the cliffs
near the ocean were studded with
caves. A 20-year-old private first
class in Company E, 2d Battalion,
23d Marines, Robert F. Graf, described
the Marine system for
dealing with these and the others
that were found all through the
bitter campaign:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The firepower was intense,
and we were working
our way up to where the
shots originated. Quite
often there would be multi
cave openings, each protecting
another. Laying down
heavy cover fire, our specialist
would advance to
near the mouth of the cave.
A satchel charge would
then be heaved into the
mouth of the cave, followed
by a loud blast as the dynamite
exploded. Other times
it might be grenades thrown
inside the cave, both fragment
type which exploded
sending bits of metal all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
throughout the cave, and
other times [white] phosphorous
grenades that burned
the enemy.</p>

<p>Also the flame thrower was
used, sending a sheet of flame
into the cave, burning anyone
that was in its path. Screams
could be heard and on occasions
the enemy would emerge
from the caves, near the entrance,
we would call upon the
tanks, and these monsters
would get in real close and
pump shells into the opening.</p></blockquote>

<p>Graf went on to picture the use
of flame-throwing tanks, the ultimate
weapon for dealing with the
enemy deep in his hideouts. He
continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some of the caves had artillery
mounted on tracks
that could be wheeled to the
entrance, fired and pulled
back, unobserved. There
were caves with reinforced
metal doors that protected
them from our artillery.
Perhaps a direct hit from a
16-inch naval gun could
have blasted it open, but
nothing else.</p></blockquote>

grabbed some grenades, approached one tank from the side, and

wounded, was also out of ammunition.</i></p></div>

<p>A fellow rifleman from Graf’s
company told him this story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You should go up and see the
huge cave that I was just in.
It was large and contained a
completely equipped operating
room, all the medical
equipment, surgical tools,
etc. The tools were made
from German surgical steel.
When the battalion and
regimental doctors were told
about it, they almost went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
crazy over finding such excellent
equipment. Each doctor
wanted some tools for his use.</p></blockquote>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>Some of the Japanese caves, such as this one, had been carefully reinforced. Marine riflemen move warily to inspect it.</i></p></div></div>

<p>These attacks on caves were a
tricky business, because of orders
not to kill any civilians who were
also inside many of them, hiding
from the fighting. Graf recounted
his experiences further:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Throughout the campaign
we were taking prisoners.</p>

<p>Seldom were they Japanese
soldiers, instead Korean and
Chamorro laborers, both men
and women, who mostly
worked in the sugar cane fields
and processing plants. Chamorros
were natives of the islands,
while the Koreans, of course,
were brought over as forced
labor. Approaching us, hands
up, and smiling and bowing the
Koreans would say in understandable
broken English, “Me
Korean, not Japanese.” Some
Japanese civilians were also
captured. The Japanese tradition
was that the male members
of the family were the dominant
members. Several times when
we tried to feed newly captured
women and children first, the
male would shove them aside
and demand to be first for rations.
A few raps to the chest
with a rifle butt soon cured
them of that habit.</p></blockquote>

<p>As the sick, scared, and often
starving civilians would emerge
from their hideouts, there were
many pitiful scenes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One sad incident I recall was
when a captured civilian Japanese
woman came up to me. She
was crying and when she got
close to me she started hitting
me on the arm and pointing to
my pack. I did not know what
she wanted until an interpreter
came over and explained that
she wanted some food and
water for her dead child. She
pointed to a wicker basket
that contained her dead infant.
I gave her what she requested,
and she placed the
food and water in the basket
so that the child could have
nourishment on the way to
meet the baby’s ancestors.</p>

<p>Physical conditions of
many were pitiful. Every illness
that we had been
briefed on was observed:
leprosy, dengue fever, yaws
and many cases of elephantiasis.
Most of them were
skeleton thin, as they had no
nourishment for many days.
Many were suffering from
shock caused by the shelling
and bombing, and fright because
they did not have the
vaguest idea as to what we
would do to them. Civilians
caught in a war that was not
of their making....</p></blockquote>

One of the captured persons impressed
Graf so very much that the
memory was vivid many years later.
A Japanese woman, obviously an
aristocrat, probably a wife or mistress
of a high-ranking officer, “was
captured. She was dressed in traditional
Japanese clothing: a brilliant
kimono, a broad sash around the
waist, hair combed, lacquered and
spotlessly clean. Although,” as Graf
remarked, “she knew not what her
fate would be in the hands of us, the
barbarians, she stood there straight,
proud, and seemingly unafraid. To
me, she seemed like a queen.”</p>

<p>Over on the west side of Saipan,
the 2d Marine Division had a memorable
day on 25 June. Ever since the
landing, the towering peak of Mount
Tapotchau had swarmed with Japanese
artillery spotters looking straight
down on every Marine move and
then calling in precisely accurate fire
on the American troops. Now, however,
in a series of brilliant tactical
maneuvers, with a battalion of the
8th Marines clawing up the eastern
slope, a battalion of the 29th Marines
(then attached to the 8th Marines)
was able to infiltrate around the right
flank in single file behind a screen of
smoke and gain the dominating peak
without the loss of a single man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at Nafutan
Point, the battalion of the 105th Infantry
assigned to clean out the by-passed
Japanese pockets had had
continuous problems. The official
Army account commented, “The attack
of the infantry companies was
frequently uncoordinated; units repeatedly
withdrew from advanced
positions to their previous night’s
bivouacs; they repeatedly yielded
ground they had gained.”</p>

<p>The stalemate came to a climax on
the night of D+11. Approximately
500 of the trapped Japanese, all the
able-bodied men who remained,
passed “undetected” or “sneaked
through” (as the Army later reported)
the lines of the encircling battalion.
The enemy headed for nearby
Aslito airfield and there was chaos
initially there. One P-47 plane was
destroyed and two others damaged.
The Japanese quickly continued on
to Hill 500, hoping to reunite there
with their main forces. What they
found instead was the 25th Marines
resting in reserve with an artillery
battalion of the 14th Marines. The escaping
Japanese were finished off the
following morning.</p>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>The 37mm gun was a workhorse for the Marines in a wide variety of firing missions. Those

<p>On the front lines in the center of
the island, General Jarman, now in
temporary command of the 27th Infantry
Division, took direct action
that same day (D+11). An inspection
by two of his senior officers of the
near edge of Death Valley revealed
that battalions of the 105th Infantry
“were standing still when there was
no reason why they should not
move forward.” That did it. Jarman
relieved the colonel commanding
the 106th and replaced him with his
division chief of staff. (Nineteen
other officers of the 27th Infantry Division
were also relieved after the
Saipan battle was over, although
only one of them had commanded a
unit in battle.)</p>

<p>While these developments were
taking place in the upper echelons,
the junior officers in the front lines
had their own, more immediate,
daily concerns. As the author
recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I had worked out a pre-sleep
routine which I followed
every night without
fail. Before I lay down, I
would make careful mental
notes of where the company
Command Post [CP] was and
where my squad leaders’ foxholes
were. Then I would
work out the rotation of the
watches with my CP group.
Next came a check of my carbine
to make sure it was in
perfect operating condition.
When all this had been done,
I’d lie down, adjusting my
helmet to serve as a pillow.
Last, and most important,
was the placing of my
weapons: my carbine lay
across my body so my hand
would fall naturally on the
trigger; my combat knife was
stuck in the ground where my
right hand lay; and my
grenades were carefully arrayed
at my left hand. Then
I’d drift off to sleep.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the next several days, the
27th Infantry Division probed and
maneuvered and attacked at Hell’s
Pocket, Death Valley, and Purple
Heart Ridge. On 28 June, Army
Major General George W. Griner,
who had been quickly sent from
Hawaii upon the relief of Ralph
Smith, took over command of the
division, so Jarman could revert to
his previous assignment as garrison
force commander. The 106th
marked the day by eradicating the
last enemy resistance in the spot
that had caused so much grief:
Hell’s Pocket.</p>

</div>

<p>The 2d Marine Division meanwhile
inched northward toward the
town of Garapan, meeting ferocious
enemy resistance. Tipo Pali was
now in 6th Marines’ hands. The 8th
Marines encountered four small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
hills strongly defended by the
enemy. Because of their size in comparison
with Mount Tapotchau,
they were called “pimples.” Each
was named after a battalion commander.
Painfully, one by one, they
were assaulted and taken over the
next few days.</p>

<p>Near Garapan, about 500 yards
to the front of the 2d Marines’ lines,
an enemy platoon on what was
named “Flame Tree Hill” was well
dug in, utilizing the caves masked
by the bright foliage on the hill. The
morning of 29 June, a heavy artillery
barrage as well as machine
gun and mortar fire raked the
slopes of the hill. Then friendly
mortars laid a smoke screen. This
was followed by a pause in all firing.
As hoped, the enemy raced
from their caves to repel the expected
attack. Suddenly the mortars
lobbed high explosives on the hill.
Artillery shells equipped with time
fuses and machine gun and rifle fire
laid down another heavy barrage.
The enemy, caught in the open, was
wiped out almost to a man.</p>

<p>To the right, the 6th Marines
mopped up its area and now held
the most commanding ground, with
all three of its battalions in favorable
positions. In fact, since replacement
drafts had not yet arrived, the
2d Marine Division had all three of
its infantry regiments deployed on
line. Thus it was necessary for its
commander, Major General Watson,
to organize a division reserve from
support units.</p>

<p>The pressure on manpower was
further illustrated by the fact that,
in this difficult terrain, “eight
stretcher bearers were needed to
evacuate one wounded Marine.” In
addition, there was, of course, the
deep-seated psychological and
physical pressure from the constant,
day after day, close combat. “Everyone
on the island felt the weight of
fatigue settling down.”</p>

On the 4th Division front, the
drive forward was easier, but its left
flank had to be bent sharply backward
toward the 27th Infantry Division.
By nightfall on 28 June, the
Marine division’s lines formed an
inverted L with the 23d Marines
and part of the 165th Infantry facing
north, while the rest of the Army
regiment and two battalions of the
24th Marines faced west. This
strange alignment was a focus of attention
when each battalion was issued
its nightly overlay from corps
headquarters showing the lines of
the corps at that time, so that
friendly fire from artillery and supporting
Navy destroyers would not
hit friendly troops. Once again,
enemy planes raided, hitting both
the airfield and anchorage. As usual,
enemy night patrols were active.</p>

<p>The end of the saga of Nafutan
Point, way to the rear, had come the
day before (27 June). The Japanese
breakout had left almost no fighting
men behind there. Accordingly, the
battalion of the 105th Infantry at
last overran the area after enduring
a final banzai charge. The soldiers
found over 500 enemy bodies in the
area, some killed in the charge and
some by their own hand.</p>

<p>D+15 (30 June) marked a good
day for the Army. After fierce fighting,
the 27th Infantry Division finally
burst through Death Valley,
captured Purple Heart Ridge, and
drew alongside the 8th Marines.
Holland Smith gave due recognition:
“No one had any tougher job
to do.” The gaps on the flanks with
the 2d and 4th Marine Divisions
were now closed. In doing so, the
Army had sustained most of the
1,836 casualties inflicted upon it
since D-Day. The 4th Marine Division,
however, had suffered 4,454
casualties to date, while the 2d Marine
Division had lost 4,488 men.</p>

<p>The corps front now ran from
Garapan, past the four pimples, to
the 4th Marine Division’s left
boundary. Here, it ran sharply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
northward to Hill 700. From there it
ran to the east coast. Central Saipan
was in American hands. Most of the
replenishment supplies had been
unloaded. The enemy had begun
withdrawing to his preplanned final
defensive lines. The Army’s official
history summed up these days’
costly victories this way, “The battle
for central Saipan can be said to
have come to a successful end.”</p>

<h2><a name="D16-D19_1-4_July" id="D16-D19_1-4_July"></a><i>D+16&ndash;D+19, 1&ndash;4 July</i></h2>

<p>Now Holland Smith turned his
attention to operation plans to drive
through the northern third of
Saipan and bring the campaign to a
successful, albeit a bloody, conclusion.
His next objective line ran
from Garapan up the west coast to
Tanapag and then eastward across
the island. Past Tanapag, near Flores
Point, the 2d Marine Division
would be pinched out and become
the corps reserve. That would leave
the 27th Infantry Division and the
4th Marine Division to assault General
Saito’s final defenses.</p>

<p>The easiest assignment during
this period fell to the 4th Marine
Division on the east coast. It advanced
3,500 yards against light opposition,
veering to its left, ending
on 4 July with its left flank some
2,000 yards north of Tanapag, right
on the west coast.</p>

<p>As usual, what looked like “light
opposition” to General Schmidt in
his divisional CP looked very different
to that tired, tense lieutenant
who described a painfully typical
rifle platoon situation on D+16:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I took the rest of my men
and we proceeded&mdash;very cautiously&mdash;to
comb the area. It
was a terrible place: the rocks
and creepers were so interwoven
that they formed an almost
impenetrable barrier;
visibility was limited to a few
feet. After what had happened
to [my wounded sergeant],
the atmosphere of the place
was very tense. We located
some rock crevices we
thought the Japs might be in,
and I tried calling to them in
our Japanese combat phrases
to come out and surrender.
This proved fruitless, and it let
the Japs know exactly where
we were, while we had no
idea of their location. Then I
tried to maneuver our flamethrower
man into a position
where he could give the
crevice a blast without becoming
a sitting-duck target himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Because of the configuration
of the ground, this
proved impossible.</p>

<p>Right about now, there was
a shot off to our left. We
started over to investigate and
all hell broke loose! A Jap automatic
weapon opened up
right beside us. We all hit the
deck automatically. No one
was hit (for a change), but we
couldn’t spot the exact location
of the weapon (as usual). I
called to the man who’d been
over on the left flank. No answer.
What had happened
to him?</p></blockquote>

<p>At this point more enemy fire spattered
around the small group of
Marines. The source seemed to be
right on top of them, so the lieutenant
told two of his men to throw some
grenades over into the area he thought
the fire was coming from&mdash;about 20
feet away. Under cover of that, the
Marines worked a rifleman forward a
couple of yards to try to get a bead on
the Japanese, but he was unable to
spot them and the enemy fire seemed
to grow heavier.</p>

<div id="ip_26" class="figcenter" style="width: 657px;">

  <div class="captionr">

<p>Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 84885</p></div>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>The only way to deal with some Japanese in their well-protected defenses was to blast them with a flame-thrower.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Now the lieutenant began to get
very worried:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here we were&mdash;completely
isolated from the rest of the
company&mdash;only half a dozen
of us left&mdash;our flank man had
disappeared and now we
were getting heavy fire from
an uncertain number of Japs
who were right in our middle
and whom we couldn’t locate!
Some of the men were getting
a little jittery I could see, so I
tried to appear as calm and
cool as I could (although I
didn’t feel that way inside!). I
decided to move back to the
other end of the hilltop and
report to [our company commander]
on the phone. If I
could get his OK, I would
then contact [another one of
our platoons] for reinforcements,
and we could move
back into this area and clean
out the Jap pocket.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pressing hard against the
Japanese defenses constantly resulted
in these kinds of face-to-face
encounters. Three days later
(D+19), Lieutenant Colonel
Chambers observed a memorable
act of bravery:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Three of our tanks came
along the road.... They
made the turn to the south
and then took the wrong
turn, which took them off
the high ground and into a
cave area where there
were literally hundreds of
Japs, who swarmed all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the tanks. We were watching
and heard on the radio that
(the lieutenant) who commanded
the tanks was hollering
for help, and I don’t blame
him. They had formed a triangle
and covered each other
with the co-axial guns as best
as they could.</p></blockquote>

<p>The commanding officer of the
1st Battalion, 25th Marines, Lieutenant
Colonel Hollis U. (“Musty”)
Mustain was nearest the crisis.
Chambers went on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mustain’s executive officer
was a regular major by the
name of Fenton Mee. Musty
and I were together, and
when radio operators told us
what was going on, Musty
turned to Mee and said, “Get
some people there and get
those tanks out.”</p>

<p>Mee turned around to his
battalion CP, who were all
staff people. He just pointed
and said, “Let’s get going.”
He turned and took off. I can
still see his face&mdash;he figured
he was going to get killed.
They got there and the Japs
pulled out. This let the tanks
get out, and they were saved.
It was one of the bravest
things I ever saw people do.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chambers also noted that, by
D+19, out of 28 officers and 690 enlisted
men in his rifle companies at
the start of the campaign, he now
had only 6 officers and 315 men left
in those companies. Counting his
headquarters company, he had just
468 men remaining of the battalion’s
original total strength of 1,050,
so one rifle company simply had to
be disbanded. The grim toll was repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
in another battalion which
had had 22 out of 29 officers and 490
enlisted men either killed or
wounded in action.</p>

<p>Next to the 4th Marine Division
was the 27th Infantry Division in
the center of the line of attack. It,
too, had a far easier time than in the
grinding experiences it had just
come through. Its advance also
veered left, and was “against negligible
resistance” with “the enemy
in full flight.” Thus it reached the
west coast, pinching off the 2d Marine
Division and allowing it to go
into reserve.</p>

<div id="ip_28" class="figcenter" style="width: 659px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>SAIPAN<br />
  <span class="smaller">5&ndash;8 JULY 1944</span></p></div></div>

<p>There was a different story in the
2d Marine Division zone of action at
the beginning of this period. On 2
July Flametree Hill was seized and
the 2d Marines stormed into Garapan,
the second largest city in the
Mariana Islands. What the regiment
found was a shambles; the town had
been completely leveled by naval
gunfire and Marine artillery.</p>

<p>The official Marine history pictures
the scene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Twisted metal roof tops now
littered the area, shielding
Japanese snipers. A number of
deftly hidden pillboxes were
scattered among the ruins. Assault
engineers, covered by
riflemen, slipped behind such
obstacles to set explosives while
flamethrowers seared the front.
Assisted by the engineers, and
supported by tanks and 75mm
self-propelled guns of the regimental
weapons company, the
2d Marines beat down the scattered
resistance before nightfall.
On the beaches, suppressing
fire from the LVT(A)s of the 2d
Armored Amphibian Battalion
silenced the Japanese weapons
located near the water.</p>

<p>Moving past the town, the
2d Marine Division drove towards
Flores Point, halfway to
Tanapag. Along the way, with
filthy uniforms, stiff with
sweat and dirt after over two
weeks of fierce fighting, the
Marines joyfully dipped their
heads and hands into the cool
ocean waters.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the other two divisions already
having veered their attack to
the left and reached the northwest
coast, the 2d Marine Division was
now able to go into corps reserve,
as planned, on 4 July. (Holland
Smith, seeing the end in sight on
Saipan, wanted this division rested
for the forthcoming assault on
neighboring Tinian Island.)</p>

<p>The Japanese, meanwhile, were
falling back to a final defensive line
north of Garapan. The American attack
of the preceding weeks had not
only shattered their manpower,
their artillery, and their tanks, but
the enemy also was desperate for
food. “Many of them had been so
pressed for provisions that they were
eating field grass and tree bark.”</p>

<h2><a name="D20-D23_5-8_July" id="D20-D23_5-8_July"></a><i>D+20&ndash;D+23, 5&ndash;8 July</i></h2>

<p>Any Japanese “withdrawal”
meant that some of their men were
left behind in caves to fight to the
death. This tactic produced again
and again for the American troops
the life-threatening question of
whether there were civilians hidden
inside who should be saved.
There was a typical grim episode
at this time for First Lieutenant
Frederic A. Stott, in the 1st Battalion,
24th Marines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On this twenty-first day of
the battle we trudged along a
circuitous route to relieve the
23d Marines for an attack
scheduled for 1300. A normal
artillery preparation preceded
it, followed by the morale-lifting
rockets, but neither they
nor mortar fire could eliminate
many cave-dwelling Japs. And
again the cost was heavy.
Using civilian men, women,
and children as decoys, the Jap
soldiers managed to entice a
volunteer patrol forward into
the open to collect additional
civilian prisoners. A dozen
men from A Company were
riddled as the ruse succeeded.</p></blockquote>

<p>This kind of treacherous action
by the Japanese was demonstrated
in a different form on the following
day (D+21). Lieutenant
Colonel Chambers described how
he dealt summarily with it&mdash;and,
by contrast how his men treated
genuine civilians who had been
hiding:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... a few of the Japs had
played possum by smearing
blood of other Japs on themselves
and lying still as the
Marines came up. However,
within the battalion my instructions
were “if it didn’t
stink, stick it.” [My officer]
just laughed and said the
Marines had bayoneted all
the bodies. You had to do it!</p>

<p>We also picked up several
civilian prisoners, including
some women and children. The
thing that really got to me was
watching these boys of mine;
they’d take all kinds of risks;
they’d go into a cave never
knowing whether there would
be soldiers in there, to bring
out these civilians. The minute
they got them out, they began
to feed them, give them part of
their rations, and offer their
cigarettes to the men. It made
you feel proud of the boys for
doing this.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once the 2d Marine Division became
corps reserve, it was obvious
to General Smith that the time was
ripe for a banzai attack. He duly
warned all units to be alert, and
paid a personal visit on 6 July to
General Griner, of the 27th Infantry
Division, to stress the likelihood of
an attack coming down the coastline
on the flat ground of the Tanapag
Plain.</p>

<p>General Saito was now cornered
in his sixth (and last) command
post, a miserable cave in
Paradise Valley north of Tanapag.
The valley was constantly raked
by American artillery and naval
gunfire; he had left only fragmentary
remnants of his troops; he
was himself sick, hungry, and
wounded. After giving orders for
one last fanatical banzai charge,
he decided to commit hara-kiri in
his cave. At 10 a.m. on 6 July, facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
east and crying “Tenno
Haika! Banzai! [Long live the
Emperor! Ten thousand ages!],” he
drew his own blood first with his
own sword and then his adjutant
shot him and Admiral Nagumo in
the head with a pistol, but not before
he said, “I will meet my staff
in Yasakuni Shrine 3 a.m., 7 July!”
This was to be the time ordered
for the commencement of the
final attack.</p>

<p>The ultimate outcome was clear
to Saito: “Whether we attack, or
whether we stay where we are,
there is only death.”</p>

<p>The threat of a mad, all-out
enemy charge was nothing new to
the troops on Saipan. A rifleman recounted
one such experience:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whenever we cornered the
enemy and there was no way
out, we faced the dreaded banzai
attack. The 23d Marines
had a few of these during our
Saipan adventure, as did all the
other outfits. I dreaded these
attacks and yet welcomed
them, which is quite a paradox.
They generated a great deal of
fear but, when it was over, that
particular sector was Jap-free.</p>

<p>For hours, we could hear
them preparing for their banzai
attack, as it was the end for
them and they knew it. Because
it was against their heritage,
their training, and their
belief, they would not surrender.
All that was left was a
final charge, a pouring in of all
their troops in one concentrated
place with their pledge
to take as many of us with
them as possible.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>His account continued with a
dramatic description of the tense
waiting he endured, while he listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
to the enemy “yells and
screams going on for hours.” The
noise increased as Marine artillery
and mortars, pounding in the direction
of the Japanese sounds, added
to the deafening din. The Marines
were waiting in their foxholes with
clips of ammo placed close at hand
so that they could reload fast, fixing
their bayonets onto their rifles, ensuring
that their knives were loose
in their scabbard all in anticipation
of the forthcoming attacks. Listening
to the screaming, all senses
alert, many of the men had prayers
on their lips as they waited. Unexpectedly,
there was silence, a silence
that signaled the enemy’s advance.
Then:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suddenly there is what
sounded like a thousand people
screaming all at once, as a
hoard of “mad men” broke out
of the darkness before us.
Screams of “Banzai” fill the air,
Japanese officers leading the
“devils from hell,” their
swords drawn and swishing in
circles over their heads. Jap
soldiers were following their
leaders, firing their weapons
at us and screaming “Banzai”
as they charged toward us.</p>

<p>Our weapons opened up,
our mortars and machine guns
fired continually. No longer do
they fire in bursts of three or
five. Belt after belt of ammunition
goes through that gun, the
gunner swinging the barrel
left and right. Even though Jap
bodies build up in front of us,
they still charged us, running
over their comrades’ fallen
bodies. The mortar tubes became
so hot from the rapid
fire, as did the machine gun
barrels, that they could no
longer be used.</p>

<p>Although each [attack] had
taken its toll, still they came in
droves. Haunting memories
can still visualize the enemy
only a few feet away, bayonet
aimed at our body as we
empty a clip into him. The momentum
carries him into our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
foxhole, right on top of us.
Then pushing him off, we reload
and repeat the procedure.</p>

<p>Bullets whiz around us,
screams are deafening, the
area reeks with death, and the
smell of Japs and gunpowder
permeate the air. Full of fear
and hate, with the desire to
kill ... [Our enemy seems to
us now to be] a savage animal,
a beast, a devil, not a
human at all, and the only
thought is to kill, kill, kill....
Finally it ends.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the wild chaos that
General Smith predicted as the
final convulsive effort of the Japanese.
And it came indeed in the
early morning hours of 7 July
(D+22), the climactic moment of
the battle for Saipan. The theoretical
Japanese objective was to
smash through Tanapag and Garapan
and reach all the way down to
Charan-Kanoa. It was a “fearful
charge of flesh and fire, savage and
primitive.... Some of the enemy
were armed only with rocks or a
knife mounted on a pole.”</p>

<p>The avalanche hit the 105th Infantry,
dug in for the night with two
battalions on the main line of resistance
and the regimental headquarters
behind them. However, those
two forward battalions had left a
500-yard gap between them, which
they planned to cover by fire.</p>

<p>The Japanese found this gap,
poured through it, and headed pell-mell
for the regimental headquarters
of the 105th. The men of the
frontline battalions fought valiantly
but were unable to stop the banzai
onslaught.</p>

<p>Three artillery battalions of the
10th Marines behind the 105th were
the next target. The gunners could
not set their fuses fast enough, even
when cut to four-tenths of a second,
to stop the enemy right on top of
them. So they lowered the muzzles
of their 105mm howitzers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
spewed ricochet fire by bouncing
their shells off the foreground.
Many of the other guns could not
fire at all, since Army troops ahead
of them were inextricably intertwined
with the Japanese attackers.
However, other Marines in the artillery
battalions fired every type of
small weapon they could find. The
fire direction center of one of their
battalions was almost wiped out,
and the battalion commander was
killed. The cane field to their front
was swarming with enemy troops.
The guns were overrun and the Marine
artillerymen, after removing
the firing locks of their guns, fell
back to continue the fight as infantrymen.</p>

<p>The official history of the 27th
Infantry Division recounts sadly
the reactions of its fellow regiments
when the firestorm broke on the
105th. The men of the nearby 165th
Infantry chose that morning to
“stand where they were and shoot
Japs without any effort to move forward.”
By 1600 that afternoon, after
finally starting to move to the relief
of the shattered 105th, the 165th
“was still 200 to 300 yards short” of
making contact. This tardiness was
unfortunately matched by “the long
delay in the arrival of the 106th Infantry”
to try to shore up the battered
troops of the 105th.</p>

<p>The extraordinarily bitter hand-to-hand
fighting finally took the
momentum out of the Japanese
surge, and it was stopped at last at
the CP of the 105th some 800 yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
south of Tanapag. By 1800 most of
the ground lost had been regained.</p>

<p>It had been a ghastly day. The
105th Infantry’s two battalions had
suffered a shocking 918 casualties
while killing 2,295 Japanese. One of
the Marine artillery battalions had
127 casualties, but had accounted
for 322 of the enemy. A final count
of the Japanese dead reached the
staggering total of 4,311, some due
to previous shell-fire, but the vast
majority killed in the banzai charge.</p>

<p>Amidst the carnage, there had
been countless acts of bravery. Two
that were recognized by later
awards of the Army Medal of
Honor were the leadership and
“resistance to the death” of Army
Lieutenant Colonel William J.
O’Brien, commander of a battalion
of the 105th Infantry, and one of
his squad leaders, Sergeant
Thomas A. Baker.</p>

<p>Three Marines each “gallantly
gave his life in the service of his
country” and were posthumously
awarded the Navy Medal of Honor.
They were Private First Class
Harold C. Agerholm, Private First
Class Harold G. Epperson, and
Sergeant Grant F. Timmerman.</p>

<p>The 3d Battalion, 10th Marines,
which had fought so tenaciously in
the banzai assault, received the
Navy Unit Commendation. Four
years later, the 105th Infantry and
its attached tank battalion were
awarded the Army Distinguished
Unit Citation.</p>

<p>While attention centered on the
bloody battle on the coast, the 23d
Marines was attacking a strong
Japanese force well protected by
caves in a cliff inland. The key to
their elimination was an ingenious
improvisation. In order to provide
fire support, truck-mounted rocket
launchers were lowered over the
cliff by chains attached to tanks.
Once down at the base, their fire,
supplemented by that of rocket
gunboats off shore, snuffed out the
enemy resistance.</p>

<p>The next day, D+23, 8 July, saw
the beginning of the end. The
Japanese had spent the last of their
unit manpower in the banzai
charge; now it was time for the final
American mop-up. LVTs rescued
men of the 105th Infantry who had
waded out from the shore to the
reef to escape the Japanese. Holland
Smith then moved most of the 27th
Infantry Division into reserve, and
put the 2d Marine Division back on
the line of attack, with the 105th Infantry
attached. Together with the
4th Marine Division, they swept
north towards the end of the island.</p>

<p>Along the coast there were
bizarre spectacles that presaged a
macabre ending to the campaign.
The official Marine history pictured
the scene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The enemy pocketed in the
area had destroyed themselves
in suicidal rushes from the
high cliffs to the rocky beach
below. Many were observed,
along with hundreds of civilians,
wading out into the sea
and permitting themselves to
be drowned. Others committed
hara-kiri with knives, or
killed themselves with
grenades. Some officers, using
their swords, decapitated
many of their troops.</p></blockquote>

<h3 title="Navy Chaplains">Navy Chaplains</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Two</span> types of non-combatants are attached to Marine
units: members of the Navy Medical Corps and
Navy Chaplain Corps. Whenever the Marines are
in combat, they are well tended to in body and soul on
the front lines. Navy Lieutenant John H. Craven, Chaplain
Corps, earned the Bronze Star for his actions under
fire on Saipan. Later he summarized activities:</p>

<p>“In combat our main action was to go from place to
place, unit to unit, and start out early in the morning and
go till dark, just visiting one unit after the other and
many times just have a very brief service. We had some
very small hymn books ... and some Testaments I could
carry in my map case, and we would just gather a few
men together in a bomb crater or defilade ... and I would
have one service after the other. Sometimes we had
twelve, thirteen, or fourteen of those in one day, especially
on Sunday....</p>

<p>“Then we had to take our turn at the cemetery. Each
chaplain from different units would go down and take his
turn for burial. We had a brief committal service for each
one as they brought the bodies in. And I set myself up to
try to keep up with all of the men of our units: where they
were, whether they were in the hospital. I worked closely
with a sergeant major and it was amazing how we were
able to keep up with men, and when they were killed and
when and where they were buried.”</p>

<p>Craven kept a notebook listing all the casualties, and
he would keep that current from day to day. Each
evening he would compare notes with the regimental
sergeant major. It was a help to any chaplain to know
who were casualties and where, and to report and work
with their friends, and it was also a help to the sergeant
major because it verified reports he got.</p>

<p>When Chaplain Craven and the other chaplains returned
to the rear areas with their units, they started writing
letters to the families of everyone who was killed in
the regiment, and added their letters to those the commanding
officers were required to write.</p>

<p>One other regimental chaplain used a special type of
ministration. He had a canvas gas-mask carrier slung
over each shoulder. In one carrier he had Scotch whiskey,
in the other fried chicken. As he knelt by each young,
frightened, wounded Marine, he was invariably asked,
“Am I going to be O.K.?” “Sure you are!” was the cheerful
answer. “While you are waiting to be evacuated, would
you rather have a drumstick or a wing?” The young Marine
would be so surprised he would forget about himself.
Then, when the chaplain asked if he wanted to wash
it down with a swig of Scotch, he couldn’t believe he was
hearing correctly amidst all the confusion, noise, and
death all around him.</p>

<p>A young doctor, hearing about this chaplain, said,
“That man probably saved more young lives from dying
of shock than will ever be known.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="D24_9_July" id="D24_9_July"></a><i>D+24, 9 July</i></h2>

<p>It was to be the final day of a
long, grueling campaign. The 6th
and 8th Marines came down from
the hills to the last western beaches,
while the 4th Marine Division, with
the 2d Marines attached, reached
Marpi Point, the northern end of
the island.</p>

<p>There a final drama of horror
was played out. Lieutenant Colonel
Chambers watched, amazed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>During this day as we
moved along the cliffs and
caves, we uncovered civilians
all the time. The Jap soldiers
would not surrender, and
would not permit the civilians
to surrender. I saw with
my own eyes women, some
carrying children, come out
of the caves and start toward
our lines. They’d be shot
down by their own people. I
watched any number of
women carrying children
come down to the cliffs that
dropped to the ocean.</p>

<p>They were very steep, very
precipitous. The women
would come down and throw
the children into the ocean and
jump in and commit suicide. I
watched one group at a distance
of perhaps 100 yards,
about eight or ten civilian
men, women and children get
into a little huddle and blow
themselves up.... It was a
sad and terrible thing, and yet
I presume quite consistent
with the Japanese rules of
Bushido.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Stott in that same division
witnessed other unbelievable
forms of self-destruction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Interpreters were summoned,
and they pleaded by
amplifier for the civilians to
come forward in surrender.
No movement followed....
The people drew closer together
into a compact mass. It
was still predominantly civilians,
but several in uniform
could be distinguished circling
about in the throng and using
the civilians for protection. As
they huddled closer, sounds of
a weird singing chant carried
up to us. Suddenly a waving
flag of the Rising Sun was unfurled.
Movement grew more
agitated; men started leaping
into the sea, and the chanting
gave way to startled cries, and
with them the popping sound
of detonating grenades. It was
the handful of soldiers, determined
to prevent the surrender
or escape of their kinfolk, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
tossed grenades into the
milling throng of men, women,
and children, and then dived
into the sea from which escape
was impossible. The exploding
grenades cut the mob into
patches of dead, dying, and
wounded, and for the first
time we actually saw water
that ran red with human
blood.</p></blockquote>

<p>With this kind of fanaticism characterizing
the Japanese, it is not surprising
that 23,811 of the enemy
were known dead, with uncounted
thousands of others charred by
flamethrowers and sealed forever in
their caves. Only 736 prisoners of
war were taken, and of these 438
were Koreans. American casualties
numbered 3,225 killed in action,
13,061 wounded in action, and 326
missing in action.</p>

<p>The island was officially declared
“secured” at 1615 on 9 July (although
“mopping up” continued afterwards).
The 4th Marine Division
was later awarded the Presidential
Unit Citation for its “outstanding
performance in combat” on Saipan
and its subsequent assault on the
neighboring island of Tinian.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="Saipans_Legacy" id="Saipans_Legacy"></a><i>Saipan’s Legacy</i></h2>

<p>The campaign on Saipan had
brought many American casualties,
and it also heralded the kind of fighting
which would be experienced in
subsequent operations in the Central
and Western Pacific in the days that
lay ahead in the Pacific War. Holland
Smith declared it “the decisive battle
of the Pacific offensive” for it
“opened the way to the home islands.”
Japanese General Saito had
written that “the fate of the Empire
will be decided in this one action.” A
Japanese admiral agreed, “Our war
was lost with the loss of Saipan.” It
had truly been a “strategic strike” for
the United States.</p>

<p>The proof of these fundamental
judgements was dramatized four
months later, when 100 B-29
bombers took off from Saipan
bound for Tokyo.</p>

<p>There were other fateful results.
The United States now had a secure
advanced naval base for further punishing
strikes close to enemy shores.
Emperor Hirohito was now forced to
consider a diplomatic settlement of
the war. The militaristic General Tojo,
the Premier, and his entire cabinet fell
from power on 18 July, nine days
after Saipan’s loss.</p>

<p>The lessons learned in this campaign
would be observed in future
American operations, as flaws were
analyzed and corrected. The clear
need to improve aviation support for
the ground troops led directly to the
better results in the Philippine Islands
and on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The
artillery-spotting missions flown by
VMO-2 and -4, set a pattern for the
use of the light planes in the future.</p>

<p>Naval gunfire support was also
closely reviewed. General Saito had
written, “If there just were no naval
gunfire, we feel we could fight it out
with the enemy in a decisive battle.”
While more than 8,500 tons of ammunition
were fired by U.S. Navy
ships, the flat trajectory of the naval
guns “proved somewhat limiting,”
as the shells didn’t have the plunging
and penetrating effect which
was needed against Japanese
strongholds.</p>

<p>Finally, there were lessons
learned from the supply confusion
that had marred the early days on
the beaches and hadn’t improved
much since the days of the Guadalcanal
landing. Logistic problems
had arisen because, once a beach
was in friendly hands, the ships
were unloaded as rapidly as possible
and the sailors in the landing
craft were in a hurry to get into the
beaches and back out again. Supplies
were spread all over the
beach, partly because of the
enemy’s artillery and mortar harassing
fire on the beaches, but also
because of the corps’ hard-driving,
rapid attack, the estimate of resupply
requirements was far too small.
For example, a shortage of radio
batteries was never corrected. There
was insufficient time to sort and
separate equipment and supplies
adequately. Consequently, there
were mix-ups, with Marine uniforms
getting into Army dumps
and Army supplies showing up in
Marine dumps.</p>

<p>It was after the beach confusion
at Saipan that the Navy decided a
permanent corps shore party
should be organized. It would be
solely responsible for the movement
of all supplies from the beach
to the dumps and for the subsequent
issue to the divisions.</p>

<p>Tactical lessons learned were also
new to the Central Pacific war. Instead
of a small atoll, the battle had
been one of movement on a sizable
land mass, and it was further complicated
by the numerous caves and
the defensive systems they provided
for the Japanese. The enemy
had defended caves before, but
never on such a large scale. On
Saipan, these caves were both natural
and man-made. Often natural
vegetation gave them excellent
camouflage. Some had steel doors
which could be opened for an artillery
piece or machine gun to fire,
and then retreat behind the door before
return fire could take effect.
The flame-throwing tanks could
reach many of these caves and so
proved very useful. Unfortunately,
their range was limited on Saipan,
but this was later improved.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the hard experiences
on Saipan led to a variety
of changes which paid valuable
dividends in saving American
lives in the future Pacific campaigns.
And the loss of the island
was a strategic strike from which
the Japanese never recovered, as
the United States drove forward to
ultimate victory.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="Sources" id="Sources"></a><i>Sources</i></h2>

<p>There are five principal official
sources for the facts about the unit actions
on Saipan. These range from preliminary,
condensed accounts to massive,
detailed final studies which reach
down to the level of company operations.
In the interests of brevity, the author
of this monograph has limited
himself to covering the actions of regiments
and divisions, with minor special
exceptions.</p>

<p>The five sources are:</p>

<p>1) Henry I. Shaw, Jr., Bernard C.
Nalty, and Edwin T. Turnbladh, <i>Central
Pacific Drive</i>, vol. 3, <i>History of U.S. Marine
Corps Operations in World War II</i>
(Washington: Historical Branch, G-3 Division,
Headquarters, U.S. Marine
Corps, 1966).</p>

<p>2) Philip A. Crowl, <i>Campaign in the
Marianas</i>, vol 9, <i>United States Army in
World War II, The War in the Pacific</i>
(Washington: Office of the Chief of
Military History, Department of the

<p>5) Capt Edmund G. Love, USA, <i>The
27th Infantry Division in World War II</i>
(Washington: Infantry Journal Press,
1949).</p>

<p>In addition, there is a wide variety of
other literature on the Saipan operation.
This material ranges from a 19-page
essay by a Naval Academy midshipman,
to first-hand accounts appearing
in the <i>Marine Corps Gazette</i>, to wildly
subjective books dealing with individual
experiences or the “Smith vs Smith”
controversy.</p>

<p>To supplement the framework of unit
tactics, vignettes of individuals have
been drawn from two principal sources:</p>

<p>1) The Personal Papers Collection of
the Marine Corps Historical Center has
useful memoirs, particularly those of
Frederick A. Stott (473-4A32), John C.
Chapin (671-4A44), and Robert F. Graf
(1946-6B12).</p>

<p>2) In the Center’s Oral History Collection,
the author examined well over a
dozen reminiscences and found only
four that involved front-line experiences:
Lieutenant Colonel Justice M. Chambers,
USMCR (C2); Captain Carl W. Hoffman,
USMC, (H2); Lieutenant Colonel
William K. Jones, USMC, (J2); and Lieutenant
John H. Craven, ChC, USN, (C3).</p>
